# Smart Waste Management System

This project aims to revolutionize traditional waste management using IoT technologies. Our smart waste management system optimizes waste collection processes, enhances environmental sustainability, and reduces operational costs.

## Key Features

**Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilizes ESP8266 microcontrollers and ultrasonic sensors to detect waste levels in bins.

**Automated Operations**: Arduino-controlled servo motors automatically open and close bin lids based on detected waste levels.

**Data-Driven Optimization**: Central monitoring station collects and analyzes data to plan optimized waste collection routes and schedules.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Web app provides real-time bin status updates and notifications for waste management authorities.

## Technical Details

### Components: 

* ESP8266
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
* Arduino Uno
* Servo Motor SG90.
* 9V Battery or Power Bank w/ USB
* Jumper Wires
  
### System Design

**ESP8266 and Ultrasonic Setup:**

* Connection Setup: Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) connects to ESP8266 with VCC to 3V3, GND to GND, Trig to GPIO5 (D1), and Echo to GPIO4 (D2).
* Distance Measurement: ESP8266 sends a pulse via the Trig pin, measures the echo return time, and calculates the distance to the garbage.
* Data Transmission: ESP8266 sends garbage level data to a web interface and the Blynk app for real-time monitoring.
* 
**Arduino and Servo Setup:**

* Motion Detection: Ultrasonic sensor emits pulses and measures the time for the echoes to return, calculating the distance to an object.
* Lid Operation: Arduino sends a signal to the servo motor to open and close the lid based on detected motion.
  
## Environmental Benefits
* Reduced Emissions
* Waste Reduction
* Sustainable Design
* Improved Resource Allocation
